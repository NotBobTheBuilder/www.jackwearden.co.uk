    <h1>Amazing post</h1>
    <p>I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Ensign Babyface! Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? Sorry, Data. Damage report! You bet I'm agitated!</p>
    <p>I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone I am your worst nightmare! Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? I guess it's better to be lucky than good. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. We know you're dealing in stolen ore.</p>
